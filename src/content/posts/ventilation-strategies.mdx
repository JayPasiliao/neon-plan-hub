# Ventilation Strategies for Hot and Humid Weather

Effective ventilation is crucial for comfort in the Philippine climate. These strategies can significantly reduce your reliance on air conditioning.

## Key Takeaways

- **Cross-ventilation** is the most effective natural cooling method
- **Stack effect** uses rising hot air to create airflow
- **Window placement** determines ventilation effectiveness
- **Roof vents** are essential for heat removal
- **Landscaping** can enhance natural airflow

## Energy Savings Table

| Ventilation Method | Potential Savings | Implementation Cost |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cross Ventilation | 30-50% cooling cost | ₱15,000 - ₱25,000 |
| Stack Ventilation | 20-35% cooling cost | ₱20,000 - ₱40,000 |
| Solar Chimneys | 25-40% cooling cost | ₱30,000 - ₱60,000 |

## Practical Ventilation Tips

### 1. Window Strategy
- Place windows on opposite walls
- Higher windows for hot air exhaust
- Lower windows for cool air intake

### 2. Roof Solutions
- Ridge vents for continuous airflow
- Soffit vents for air intake
- Proper insulation to reduce heat gain

### 3. Landscaping Support
- Trees for shading and wind direction
- Avoid blocking natural wind paths
- Use plants to cool incoming air
